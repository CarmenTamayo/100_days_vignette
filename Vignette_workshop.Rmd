This vignette summarises the findings from the _100 days and 100 lines of code_ workshop, hosted in December 2022 by [Epiverse-TRACE](https://data.org/news/epiverse-trace-a-values-based-approach-to-open-source-ecosystems/).

## What should the first 100 lines of code written during an epidemic look like?

To answer this question, we invited 40 experts, including academics, field epidemiologists, and software engineers, to take part in a 3-day workshop, where they discussed the current challenges, and potential solutions, in data analytic pipelines used to analyse epidemic data.

### What R packages and tools are available to use during an epidemic?  
To investigate this in a similar setting to what an outbreak response team would experience, workshop participants were divided into groups, and asked to develop a plausible epidemic scenario, that included:

* A situation report, describing the characteristics of the epidemic

* A linelist of cases and contact tracing data, by modifying provided datasets containing simulated data

* A set of questions to address during the analytic process

Groups then exchanged epidemic scenarios and analysed the provided data to answer the questions indicated the previous group, as if they were a response team working to solve an outbreak.
Details about each of these outbreak scenarios and the analytic pipelines developed by the groups are summarised in this vignette

### Simulating epidemic data

Before the workshop, a fictitious dataset was created, which consisted of a linelist and contact tracing information.

To generate linelist data, the package [`bpmodels`](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/bpmodels) was used to generate a branching process network. Cases were then transformed from the model output to a linelist format. To add plausible hospitalisations and deaths, delay distributions for SARS-CoV were extracted from [`epiparameter`](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter).

To create the contact tracing database, a random number of contacts was generated for each of the cases included in the linelist. These contacts were then assigned a category of _became case_, _under follow up_ or _lost to follow up_, at random.

* Through this workshop, we identified the need for a tool to simulate outbreak data in a linelist format, to test analysis methods and other packages while having control over the characteristics of the test data. For this purpose, an R package is currently in progress, see [simulist](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/pitcher/issues/7).
